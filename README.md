# OWASP-Juice-Shop-penetration-testing-report


It was a great experience executing our first penetration testing engagement and writing a full penetration testing report.

This engagement was done on an open-source website owned by OWASP: OWASP Juice-Shop (https://lnkd.in/dY8PZm3P
). It was based on a team comprised of me and Youssef Abdellatif.

This was our final project for the Software and Mobile Security course taught by Associate Professor, Dr. Amr El Mougy and Teaching Assistant, Merna Said.

Because the course had a solid theoretical foundation, we were able to apply this theoretical knowledge on the engagement allowing us to further deepen our understanding of penetration testing tools and techniques. Furthermore, the experience has taught us how to write reports effectively such that they are understood by all stakeholders.

The penetration testing field is one we find interesting and we are open to start working in real-world engagements.
